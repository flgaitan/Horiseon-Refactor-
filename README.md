## On the job ticket- Refactoring

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

The motivation for this project was to make meet the requirements that were asked in order to provide the service that was seeked.
I build this project so that I could take a look at a code that was already built, and recognize what it needed  or perhaps what could
be simplified. in this case, the code for the website needed accessibility features to satisfy all clients that come to visit the site
and make it more accesssible for them as well. Adding accessibility solved the problem that the site was lacking, and it presents a
better version of how the site works now.
- In the process I learned countless things about the way html elements speak to the page, how they are put together and how they go 
hand in hand with styles in CSS. I found this to be particularly important becuase it presented a bigger challenge than figuring out
the coding itself. Making sure that the elements work together is just as important as defining what needs to be in the page.

## Installation

In this particular project we did not need to install anything in specific. But we did need to launch the page.

## Usage

The purpose of this project was the improve usage, which in order to do that we need to apply elements that meet accessibility
standards when the code is viewed.
Apply or refactor semantic elements within the structure of the HTML configuration, and make sure that the follow a logical
strcuture independent of styling and positioning. This concept is applied to headings and/or titles as well to make sure they
follow a sequential order and also to make it easy to find concise, descriptive elements within our webpage structure.
